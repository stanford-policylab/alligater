    The available treatments are specified as a list of Variants, which

    Variant assignment is governed by the rules in the Rollouts. A Rollout
    specifies how to distribute treatments among a Population. The Population
    can be defined using an arbitrary set of selection criteria -- it might
    represent 100% of users, or a randomly-selected 25% of users, or only users
    who fit certain criteria. The Variant that will be assigned to a member
    of the Population is chosen randomly by the weights assigned to the
    Rollout's treatment Arms.

    Multiple Rollouts can be specified. A default Rollout comprised of the
    entire population *must* be specified, to guarantee that every input will
    be assigned a Variant (even if that Variant is something trivial, like
    `None` or "off"). The `default_arm` arg can be used to specify this easily.
