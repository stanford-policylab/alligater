# Alligater

This is a flexible feature-gating library.

Detailed documentation is in the classes themselves. The quickstart version is:

```py
from alligater import *



# 1. Create the gater withe your list of features.
gater = Alligater(
        features=[
            # This feature will be rolled out randomly to 25% of users.
            Feature(
                'my_feature',
                variants=[
                    Variant('on', True),
                    Variant('off', False),
                    ],
                rollouts=[Rollout(
                  name='my_rollout',
                  population=Population.Percent(0.25, 'seed_value'),
                  arms=['on'],
                  )],
                default_arm='off',
                ),
            ],
        )


# 2. In your code, evaluate your feature when you need to assign a treatment.

# The gater can work for arbitrary objects, but by default it expects that
# the input entity has an `id` attribute or key. This is used for any
# randomization that happens as part of the feature's logic.
some_user = {"id": "id_of_the_user"}

if gater.my_feature(some_user):
    # The feature returned `True` (the `on` variant) for this user!
    # Apply that logic here.
    ...
else:
    # The gate returned `False` (the `off` variant).
    ...
```

## Features:

1. Create any number of features with any number of treatment options.
2. Hierarchical feature definitions. Treatments can be other features. These are evaluated recursively.
3. Load feature definitions from YAML (either from a local file or a remote URL).
4. Flexible targetting. features can target multiple populations with arbitrarily complex logic, assigning treatments either randomly or explicitly.
5. Stable assignments. Choices (even random ones) made by the gater are deterministic.
6. Robust logging. Assignment choices can be inspected in detail with trace logging. The "state of the world" trace can also be logged as needed for experiment analysis. A couple of logger implementations are provided; the `print` function also works.
7. Targetting expressions can be written in a simple syntax in the YAML files, like `$language In ['en', 'es']`. This gives the YAML configs nearly as much flexibility as defining features in code.
8. Features access is threadsafe.
9. YAML-based features can be live-reloaded at a configurable interval.
10. Rollouts support specifying start and end times, with flexible determination of time.
11. Complete tests.

## To do

The current implementation is essentially feature complete. This is a list of
known limitations:

- [ ] Expression DSL does not support Map types
